 I have to figure out how what vehicles i want to use,
  and what is the relevant characteristics of them.
  
  need to figure out the payload weight and the effects that it has on the vehicle

 I need to figure out what is the orbital longitudes of all the planets

 i have to figure out how to escape the planets orbit

 i have to figure out the hohman transfer
 
 figure out how to capture into that planets orbit
 
 failure function that throws if a vehicle cannot make the 
 
 journey at any point
 
 ##the app needs to tell you;
 
 
* what 
* when the best times to launch is,
    1.  find out the planets distances from the sun with plenty of time for the next 10 years
* how long it'll take,
* what the best vehicle for the mission would be,
* how much ∆v is required,
* whether your selected vehicle can make the journey,
* what is required for a return trip. if the user wanrts to make one

##notes

how long is it going to take?- keplers 3rd law {
the period of a complete orbit = time to complete orbit in 
years^2 = semimajor axis of orbit^3
semimajor axis = to distance between sun & earth + sun & mar / 2 in 
astronomical units. 
* AU = distance between sun and earth
* Sun to Maers = 1.52366 AU
