# Welcome to my little junkyard/playground.

This is where I store my pet projects that I do for fun,
 or things that I'm learning that I think I need to practice with more.
 
 ## it's not going to be pretty
 
 there's a ot of stuff here that for one reason or another I haven't finished.
 But hopefully i'll get some time to complete it.
